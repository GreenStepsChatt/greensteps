    # This can be much simpler once we can use the :backdrop pseudo element. We
    # All we'll have to do here is toggle the drawer, I think that the backdrop
    # will just become visible once the drawer is. We'll need to add a click
    # event for the drawer's :backdrop pseudo element so that a click on it
    # still triggers the drawer to close. Not sure how we'd do the fading effect
    # for the overlay/backdrop, but we'll just have to see what happens when we
    # only toggle the drawer with slide effect.
