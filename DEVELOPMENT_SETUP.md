# Development Setup
Before getting started, you'll need to have Ruby 2.4.2 and Postgres 9.6
installed on your machine. If you need help with this, check out the setup guide
from [Go Rails](https://gorails.com/setup). Rather than following the last set
of steps to create a new app, you'll
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo and then create
a local clone to work with. If you need help with things like forking, cloning,
and git in general, we recommend Udacity's [How to Use Git and
GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) course.

You will also need
[ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) installed.
On a Mac simply run `brew install chromedriver`.

Once you have a copy of this project on your machine, you should run
`bin/setup`. At this point, it's a good idea to

1. run `bin/rspec` to make sure everything was installed properly
2. start the server and explore the app
